Although I can wrap my head around most domains in the IT industry, be it Back-end, DevOps, I decide to stick to front-end development for now, as it feels like home to me.`;

export const CONTENT_LIFESTORY = `Since High School, I have always dreamt of creating software products that better our lives. My journey started with Python - a simple yet powerful language which allowed me to create simple apps, like a calculator, a Pomodoro Timer, and so on.
Shortly after entering the University, I got to know awesome tech geeks, as thanks to them, I had learnt more about different technologies, for example, API, Containerzation..., and apply them in some of my personal projects.
Throughout such a journey, there were times when I felt like giving up halfway. But the joy of seeing your brainchildren up and running as expected has propelled me forward.
Hence, I would love to put into good use my perseverance, and some other soft skills, including concise communication, teamwork, open-mindedness.`;

        The first time I took up badminton was 6 years ago, when I was just a high school student. Back then, I was fortunate enough to exchange skills with professional players, who had a lot of tricks up their sleeves. <br/><br/>
        Most importantly, however, they were easy-going for newcomers, and ready to cover/support newbies like me during intense matches. So‚Ä¶ special shoutout to them for shaping a not-so-horrible player like who I am today. ü§£ <br/><br/>
        And until now, I still decide to stick to this badass sport, as it helps me improve qualities that, I believe, no other alternatives can do, including agility, stamina, and sportsmanship.

        Long before I began engaging in motorcycle trips, I once had a time taking bicycle trips around my hometown. The feeling of taking in fresh sea breeze, or having a wide vision of surrounding scenery, while slowly pedaling, ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable. <br/><br/>
        I believe such days have also molded me into someone who derives joy from taking motorbike trips around HCMC during my free time. <br/><br/>
        I have been thinking about taking long trips to different provinces in the country. But, safety issues explains why I'm still hesitant to take such trips. <br/><br/>

        Ah yes, my so-called ‚Äúliquid nitrogen of the day‚Äù (laughs). Just a trivia, do you know that overclocking masters use liquid nitrogen to boost CPU frequencies to shocking numbers? Well, this applies the same for me, as without coffee, I can say that most of my daily productivity is wasted. <br/><br/>
        This is also probably my most commonly ordered drink, especially during the university days, when I and my classmates hung out at different coffee shops to speedrun group projects. <br/><br/>
        And definitely, one of my future goals/dreams is to work on a laptop, by the window, with a cup of coffee, and in front of me would be a garden of some kind. <br/><br/>
