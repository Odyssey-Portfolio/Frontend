Although I can wrap my head around most domains in the IT industry, be it Back-end, DevOps, I decide to stick to front-end development for now, as it gives me joy and motivation to satisfy my desires.`

export const CONTENT_LIFESTORY = `Since High School, I have always dreamt of creating software products that better our lives. My journey started with Python - a simple yet powerful language which allowed me to create simple apps, like a calculator, a Pomodoro Timer, and so on.
Shortly after entering the University, I got to know awesome tech geeks, as thanks to them, I had learnt more about different technologies, for example, API, Containerzation..., and apply them in some of my personal projects.
Throughout such a journey, there were times when I felt like giving up halfway. But the joy of seeing your brainchildren up and running as expected has propelled me forward.
Hence, I would love to put into good use my perseverance, and some other soft skills, including concise communication, teamwork, open-mindedness.`
