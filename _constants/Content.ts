export const CONTENT_LIFESTORY = `Back in High School, I always dreamt of creating software products that served our lives in various ways. With that in mind, I started experimenting with Python - a simple programming language which allowed me to create simple apps, like a calculator, a Pomodoro Timer, and so on.
After being admitted into the University for a few months, I befriended with those sharing passions for writing real-world applications. Thanks to them, I got to learn more about different technologies, for example, ASP.NET Core API, and apply them in some of my personal projects.
Throughout such a journey, I have bumped into various bugs, errors, and honestly, there were times when I felt like giving up halfway. But the joy of getting over them, and making your product function properly, propelled me forward.
Hence, I would love to put my perseverance, and some other soft skills, including concise communication, teamwork, open-mindedness into good use. In other words, I have wanted to contribute to the development of different software products in the foreseeable future.`
